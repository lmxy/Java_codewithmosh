write code that can leverage these multi core processors. This makes your applications faster and more responsive. We'll start this section with a quick overview of key terms and concepts, such as processes and threads. We'll talk about starting, pausing and interrupting threads. Then we'll look at concurrency issues such as threads conditions and visibility problems. These are the issues that can exist in all concurrent system. They'are not specific to Java. So we look at this problems, and then I will show you various strategies to prevent them. Look at synchronization, volatile fails, atomic objects, and other types made for this purpose.
# Processes and Threads
Let's start this section with a quick overview of the key terms and ideas in concurrent systems. The one key term to understand is process. A process is an instance of a program or an application. When you launch an application like your code editor or music player, you're operating system loads that application inside a process. So process contains an image of applications code. It has some memory and a bunch of other resouces. Now your operating system can execute many processes at the same time. For example, it can run an antivirus while playing music. So that's concurrency at the process level, but we can also have concurrency within the process or within the application using threads. Technically speaking, a thread is a sequence of instructions. That's why it's called a thread. It's like a thread of instructions. Now, practically speaking, a thread is actually that thing that executes your code. Each process has at least one thread called the main thread, but we can create additional threads to run many tasks concurrently. For example, we can build a web server that can serve many clients at the same times, While server each client using a separate thread. Or we can build an application that downloads multiple images concurrently. We do this by starting multiple threads and have each thread download a separate image. This is what we call multi threading. Applications that use multiple threads are called multi threaded applications. Now, these days most processors have multiple cores. And this cores can be used for running many processes or threads. If your application doesn't use threads, is essentially using only one of the processor cores, so it's not utilizing the full power of your CPU, your hardware is wasted. let me show you. So I want to print thread.
